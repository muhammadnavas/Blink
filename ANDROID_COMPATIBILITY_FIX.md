# Android Notification Compatibility Fix

## Problem
The app was crashing with this error on Android:
```
ERROR ‚ùå Error sending calendar test notification: [Error: Failed to schedule the notification. Trigger of type: calendar is not supported on Android.]
```

## Root Cause
Calendar-type notification triggers (`type: 'calendar'`) are not supported on Android. The app was using calendar triggers in several functions:
- `testCalendarNotification()`
- `scheduleDailyReminder()`
- `scheduleWeeklyReminder()`

## Solution
Updated all notification functions to use Android-compatible `timeInterval` triggers instead of calendar triggers.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated `testCalendarNotification()`
- Replaced calendar trigger with `timeInterval` trigger using seconds
- Now uses `{ seconds: delaySeconds }` instead of `{ type: 'calendar', hour, minute }`

#### 2. Updated `scheduleDailyReminder()`
- Replaced calendar trigger with calculated time interval
- Now schedules a one-time notification for the next occurrence
- Added warning that true daily repeating requires background tasks

#### 3. Updated `scheduleWeeklyReminder()`
- Replaced calendar trigger with calculated time interval
- Now schedules a one-time notification for the next weekly occurrence
- Added warning about true weekly repeating

#### 4. Added New Function `testAndroidNotification()`
- Specifically designed to test Android-compatible notifications
- Uses `timeInterval` trigger only
- Added to the test buttons in the stats view

#### 5. Updated `scheduleCustomIntervalReminder()`
- Removed `type: 'timeInterval'` (not needed, just use `seconds`)
- Simplified trigger definition

#### 6. Added `scheduleRepeatingDailyReminder()`
- New function that creates both initial and repeating notifications
- Uses multiple notifications to achieve true daily repeating

#### 7. Updated `cancelNotificationByKey()`
- Now handles both regular and repeating notification identifiers
- Cancels multiple notifications if needed

### UI Changes
- Replaced "üìÖ Test 1min" button with "ü§ñ Android 1min" button
- Added compatibility note in stats view
- Updated button to use the new Android-compatible test function

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
‚úÖ **Android**: Now fully compatible using `timeInterval` triggers
‚úÖ **iOS**: Still works with `timeInterval` triggers (calendar triggers were iOS-only anyway)
‚úÖ **Web**: Compatible with Expo web builds

## Testing
Use the "ü§ñ Android 1min" button in the Stats tab to test Android-compatible notifications.

## Important Notes
- Daily/Weekly reminders now create one-time notifications for the first occurrence
- For true repeating notifications, consider:
  - Background tasks
  - Server-side scheduling
  - The new `scheduleRepeatingDailyReminder()` function
- Interval reminders still work as true repeating notifications

## Usage
The app now works on Android without the calendar notification error. All notification types are functional with timeInterval triggers.

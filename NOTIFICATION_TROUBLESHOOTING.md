# Notification Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔧 Current Issues Addressed

### Enhanced Notification System
- **Multiple Scheduling Strategies**: Date-based, Extended timeInterval, Standard fallback
- **Expo Go Detection**: Automatic environment detection and optimization
- **setTimeout Fallback**: JavaScript-based timing for Expo Go compatibility
- **Simple Scheduling**: Minimal approach for debugging

### Diagnostic Tools Added

#### 🔧 Diagnostics Button
Run comprehensive tests to identify issues:
- Check notification permissions
- Verify environment (Expo Go vs production)
- Count currently scheduled notifications
- Test simple 5-second notification
- Test enhanced 10-second notification
- Verify scheduling worked

#### 🧪 Test Enhanced Button  
Test the multi-strategy approach:
- Enhanced scheduling with fallback strategies
- setTimeout-based fallback for Expo Go
- Detailed console logging

#### ⚡ Test Now Button
Immediate notification for permission testing

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Run Diagnostics
Press the **Diagnostics** button and check:
- Permissions status should be "granted"
- Environment detection (Expo Go vs production)
- Scheduled count should increase after tests

### 2. Check Console Logs
Look for these patterns:
```
🔧 ===== COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSTICS =====
🔒 Permissions: { status: "granted" }
📱 Environment: { appOwnership: "expo" }
📅 Currently scheduled: 0
🧪 Testing simple 5-second notification...
✅ Simple scheduling ID: [ID]
📅 After scheduling: 2
```

### 3. Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Notifications appear immediately
**Solution**: This is a known Expo Go limitation since SDK 53
- Use setTimeout fallback (implemented)
- Test in production build for accurate timing

#### Issue: No notifications at all
**Check**: 
- Permissions granted?
- Device notifications enabled?
- App in foreground/background?

#### Issue: Scheduling fails
**Check**:
- Console errors during scheduling
- Invalid time values (negative, too large)
- Network connectivity for Expo Go

### 4. Test Different Approaches

#### Simple Scheduling
```javascript
scheduleSimpleNotification('Test', 'Simple test', 5)
```

#### Enhanced Multi-Strategy
```javascript
scheduleLocalNotification('Test', 'Enhanced test', 10)
```

#### Fallback with setTimeout
```javascript  
scheduleWithFallback('Test', 'Fallback test', 15)
```

## 📱 Environment-Specific Behavior

### Expo Go (Development)
- **Known limitation**: Short delays may fire immediately
- **Workaround**: setTimeout fallback implemented
- **Best for**: Testing functionality, not timing accuracy

### Production Build
- **Accurate timing**: Native scheduling works properly
- **No limitations**: All strategies should work
- **Best for**: Final timing validation

## 🔄 Current Implementation Status

✅ **Multiple scheduling strategies implemented**  
✅ **Expo Go detection and warnings added**  
✅ **setTimeout fallback for development**  
✅ **Comprehensive diagnostic tools**  
✅ **Enhanced error handling and logging**  
✅ **Fixed recursion issues**  

The system now provides multiple approaches to handle different environments and scenarios.
